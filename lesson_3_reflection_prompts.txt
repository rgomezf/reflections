When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    when I'm working with more people on the same project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks are clones in the Cloud of GitHub, clones are copies of a repository saved localy on the
	computer.  A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without replacing or affecting the original.
