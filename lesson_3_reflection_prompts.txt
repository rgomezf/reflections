When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    when I'm working with more people on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    that way I can choose which changes I want to pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks are clones in the Cloud of GitHub, clones are copies of a repository saved localy on the
	computer.  A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without replacing or affecting the original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	in case something that wasn't expected happens you can go back to that point and start over again.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	with GitHub.  I consider it'll be the easiest way.  Git the hardest one.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	while making an improvement without touching the master.  That way can be review it without stoping the funcionality of the
	master.
